Localized Noise Injection: Here we investigate how does the introduction of noise to a localized region of\n","the image affect the performance of each model?\n","Create a subset of CIFAR-10 by introducing random noise (e.g., Gaussian noise) to a small, localized region\n","(e.g., a randomly selected 32x32 pixel patch) of images selected from CIFAR-10 dataset. To isolate the effects\n","of localized noise, the same noise pattern should be applied to different images at the same location to ensure\n","consistency across tests for all models. In this way, you are simulating practical scenarios where part of an\n","image might be obscured or corrupted.\n","Measure how the introduction of this localized noise affects the accuracy of your models by comparing the\n","performance on noisy images to that on clean images.\n","2. Global Style Changes: Here we investigate how do global alterations in the style or color of the entire\n","image influence the classification accuracy of each neural network architecture?\n","4\n","Create a subset of CIFAR-10 by applying a style transfer or color shift across the entire image.

Scrambled Images: Here we investigate how do random permutations in image patches influence the classification\n","accuracy of each neural network architecture?\n","Create another subset of CIFAR-10 by dividing images into patches and randomly scrambling them.
