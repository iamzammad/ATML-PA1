To systematically\n","evaluate these biases, we will focus on three key factors: shape bias, texture bias, and color bias. For example,\n","shape bias refers to the model’s (EfficientNet-B3) ability to rely on object shape over other visual cues like texture or color. This can\n","be quantified by comparing the shape accuracy (the model’s accuracy when presented with shape-reliant data)\n","to the overall accuracy (the model’s overall accuracy across different visual cues). Shape bias can be formally\n","evaluated using the ratio:\n","Shape Bias =Shape Accuracy/Total Accuracy\n","Similarly, texture bias and color bias\n","can be measured by evaluating model performance on datasets where texture and color dominate the discriminative\n","features.\n","To conduct this analysis, you will need to create or source separate datasets to evaluate each bias individually. For\n","instance:\n","A shape bias dataset may consist of line drawings or silhouettes of objects,\n","\n","*   where only the object’s shape\n","is preserved, and other features like texture and color are removed.\n","\n","*   A texture bias dataset could include texture-based alterations of the objects, where textures are preserved\n","but shapes are distorted.\n","\n","* A color bias dataset may contain images where color is emphasized or altered in ways that challenge the\n","model’s reliance on this feature. This may require some extra thought.\n","We will use these separate datasets to compute our measures individually: e.g. the\n","performance on the shape bias dataset will be a proxy measure for our shape bias (since we have emphasized the\n","role of shape cues by taking away other pieces of information).\n","\n","By evaluating the models on these specialized datasets, you can identify which visual cues each model\n","relies on the most. This analysis will provide deeper insights into the underlying reasons for the performance\n","drops observed earlier, allowing you to pinpoint what might have gone wrong or right in the OOD evaluations.\n","Understanding these biases is crucial for improving models to achieve more human-like generalization capabilities.\n","You can also take cues from the previous sections and justify why\n","an existing dataset is a good representative for a certain type of bias (e.g. silhouettes reflecting shape bias)."],"metadata":{"id":"B9zLBudSOqN8"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jigKAJLitaYi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727676479938,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":3911,"user":{"displayName":"Raafay Kazmi","userId":"10820442952346567770"}},"outputId":"850bc7d1-3f7f-40b8-9a80-08e051036467"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: timm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (1.0.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from timm) (2.4.1+cu121)\n","Requirement already satisfied: torchvision in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from timm) (0.19.1+cu121)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from timm) (6.0.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from timm) (0.24.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from timm) (0.4.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from huggingface_hub->timm) (3.16.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: fsspec>=2023.5.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from huggingface_hub->timm) (2024.6.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.9 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from huggingface_hub->timm) (24.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from huggingface_hub->timm) (2.32.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.42.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from huggingface_hub->timm) (4.66.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions>=3.7.4.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from huggingface_hub->timm) (4.12.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch->timm) (1.13.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch->timm) (3.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch->timm) (3.1.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torchvision->timm) (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pillow!=8.3.*,>=5.3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torchvision->timm) (10.4.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch->timm) (2.1.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub->timm) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub->timm) (3.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub->timm) (2.2.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->huggingface_hub->timm) (2024.8.30)\n","Requirement already satisfied: mpmath<1.4,>=1.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch->timm) (1.3.0)\n"]}],"source":["pip install timm"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","tf.test.gpu_device_name()\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BsqBKA4B5sMy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727676482816,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":2890,"user":{"displayName":"Raafay Kazmi","userId":"10820442952346567770"}},"outputId":"38bfea6d-7946-40b1-e6ee-11625d2be918"},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive;
